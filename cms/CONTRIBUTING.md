# Contributing to cms

This guide is designed to help you get off the ground quickly contributing to cms. Reading it thoroughly will help you write useful issues, propose eloquent feature requests, and submit top-notch code that can be merged quickly. Respecting the guidelines laid out below helps make the core maintainers of the project more productive, and makes the experience of working with it more enjoyable for the community at large.

Depends on the situation, you will:
* Find bug, create an issue.
* Need more functionality, make a feature request.
* Want to contribute code, open a pull request.
* Run into issue, need help.


## Issues

Before submitting a bug or feature request:
* Have you actually read the error message?
* Have you searched for similar issues?
* Have you updated to the latest stable version of Node.js, npm and the packages you're using?
* Have you checked that it's not a problem with one of the packages you're using, rather than cms itself?
* Have you looked at what's involved in fixing/implementing this yourself?

Capable programmers should always attempt to investigate and fix problems themselves before asking for others to help. Submit a pull request instead of an issue!


## Feature requests

A great feature request contains:
* The current situation.
* How and why the current situation is problematic.
* A detailed proposal or pull request that demonstrates how the problem could be solved.
* A use caseâ€“ who needs this feature and why?
* Any caveats.


## Pull requests

A great pull request contains:
* Minimal changes. Only submit code relevant to the current issue. Other changes should go in new pull requests.
* Minimal commits. Please squash to a single commit before sending your pull request.
* No conflicts. Please rebase off the latest `development` before submitting.
* Code conforming to the existing conventions and formats. Please don't reformat whitespace.
* Passing tests. Use existing tests as a reference.
* Relevant documentation.
